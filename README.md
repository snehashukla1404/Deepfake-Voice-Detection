# Deepfake Voice Detection

A project to detect deepfake voices using machine learning techniques. This system analyzes voice samples and identifies whether they are generated by AI or produced by a human.

## ✨ Features
- Detects deepfake voices from audio samples
- Machine learning model trained on a dataset of real and fake voice recordings
- Simple and intuitive GUI for easy interaction
- Audio preprocessing for better detection accuracy

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** librosa, tensorflow, keras, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib
- **Frontend:** Tkinter (for GUI)
- **Backend:** Python 3.x
- **Audio Processing:** librosa
